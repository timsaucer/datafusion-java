# User Guide

Apache DataFusion Java is a thin Java binding over the
[Apache DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org/) query engine. SQL and
DataFrame queries execute in native Rust; results return to the JVM as
[Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) record batches over the Arrow C
Data Interface.

This guide covers installation, the `SessionContext` and `DataFrame` APIs,
Parquet ingestion, table providers, and using DataFusion as a Spark data
source over ADBC.
