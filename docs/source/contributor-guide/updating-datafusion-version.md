# Updating the DataFusion / protobuf schema version

Three things must move together when bumping DataFusion:

1. `Cargo.toml` (workspace root) — the `datafusion`, `datafusion-proto`,
   `datafusion-spark`, and `datafusion-substrait` entries in
   `[workspace.dependencies]`. Members inherit from there.
2. `pom.xml` — the `<datafusion.version>` Maven property. **Must equal
   the Cargo version**; a mismatch means JVM-built protobuf plans won't
   deserialize on the native side.
3. `pom.xml` — the `<sha512>` checksums on the two `download-maven-plugin`
   executions. These pin the downloaded `.proto` files; the build fails
   if upstream silently re-tags them, which is the desired behavior.

## Recipe

```sh
# 1. Bump the workspace dep
$EDITOR Cargo.toml                    # set datafusion = "<new>" in [workspace.dependencies]
cargo update -p datafusion

# 2. Bump the Maven property to match
$EDITOR pom.xml                       # set <datafusion.version>

# 3. Compute the new SHA-512 hashes for both `.proto` files from the
#    upstream tag you just set in step 2, then paste them into the two
#    <sha512> elements in pom.xml.
NEW=$(grep -m1 -oE '<datafusion.version>[^<]+' pom.xml | cut -d'>' -f2)
curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/datafusion/$NEW/datafusion/proto-common/proto/datafusion_common.proto" | shasum -a 512 | awk '{print $1}'
curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/datafusion/$NEW/datafusion/proto/proto/datafusion.proto" | shasum -a 512 | awk '{print $1}'
$EDITOR pom.xml                       # paste the two hashes into the <sha512> elements

# Drop the local download cache so the next build re-downloads against
# the new hashes.
rm -rf ~/.m2/repository/.cache/download-maven-plugin target/proto

# 4. Verify
make && make test
```

## Why the protobuf runtime version is separate

The protobuf runtime version (`<protobuf.version>` in `pom.xml`) tracks
the Java ecosystem (security and JDK compatibility), not DataFusion.
Bump it independently when there is a reason.
