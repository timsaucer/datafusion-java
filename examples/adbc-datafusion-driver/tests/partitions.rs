//! Full system test of ADBC partitioned execution against the example driver.
//!
//! Exercises the upstream `execute_partitions` / `read_partition` (PR
//! adbc-drivers/datafusion#32, wired in via the [patch] in Cargo.toml) end to
//! end with our custom provider: plan a query, get one descriptor per output
//! partition, then read each partition on its own and assert the union is the
//! whole table -- the same contract the Spark connector relies on.
